have the initial landing page just have a button that goes to authorization flow
Then post authorization have the input field

```/**
   * Determine whether access token has been granted and query Spotify for user info if so.
   * This is to provide personalization on initial load from the Spotify authentication redirect.
   */
  componentWillMount() {
    Spotify.tokenIsValid();
    if (window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/)) {
      Spotify.parseToken();
      this.getUserInfo();
      this.setState({loggedIn: true});
    } else if (localStorage.getItem('accessToken')) {
      Spotify.getAccessToken();
      this.getUserInfo();
      this.setState({loggedIn: true});
    } 
  }
```
getUserInfo() is a method you would write yourself

it would use `setState()` to use the user's state
then `render` method would have
`if (this.state.user) {`
